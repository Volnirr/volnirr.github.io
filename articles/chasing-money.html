  <h2>The Mindset</h2>
  <p>I've observed this occurrence in many different people (in person and on the internet) and its kinda stupid. I see this most in people who I think are relatively smart, probably around the 120 iq range to put it in those terms. These people realize that there is some system in place that they disagree with like working a 9-5 wagie job just to consoom garbage, and come to the conclusion that they *must* make money in another way. I disagree with this approach because money isn't the solution; independence is. Obviously we live in a time where we need money to live, especially in the United States, but the approach of gaining mass money in order to live a life of normalcy just feeds into the system in another, slightly more obscure way. The alternative view, which I see as true, is working to be more independent. This means you “work” to depend on the system less. I’m putting work in quotes because I’m talking about wage slave work, not taking care of your garden. If instead of working an hour to buy a 4 dollar bottle of thyme, you bought a 8 dollar thyme plant and never had to buy thyme again, you'd be winning and saving time (and thyme!).
